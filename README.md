# JS-Project-BookList 

## Motivation

In this project, I'm using OOP JavaScript to make a booklist. 
It has features such as adding and deleting a book. It also checks validation and gives error messages. 
I first wrote the code in es5 to understand the conversion to es6 classes.

## Details

This is a project on OOP JavaScript and es6 classes.
